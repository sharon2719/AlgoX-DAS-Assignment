# Comprehensive Python Implementations of Binary Trees

## 1. Splay Trees

### Characteristics:

Splay trees are a type of binary search tree that adjusts itself automatically.
When you `search for`, `insert`, or `delete` a node, the tree rearranges itself so that the accessed node moves to the top (root) of the tree.
This rearrangement helps make the tree faster for elements you use often, keeping frequently used elements near the top.

### Applications:

Splay trees are useful for speeding up access to data that is used repeatedly, like in caches or memory management systems.
They are especially effective in situations where some data is accessed much more frequently than others (like the 80-20 rule, where 80% of the accesses are to 20% of the data).A good example is searching for frequently used contact as seen in [here](splay-tree.py)

## 2. B-trees

### Characteristics:

B-trees are a kind of balanced tree that keeps data sorted and allows you to `search`, `add`, and `delete` data quickly.
Unlike regular binary trees, B-trees can have `more than two child nodes`, which helps keep the tree balanced and efficient.
They are designed to work well with systems that deal with large blocks of data, like databases and file systems.

### Applications:

B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems because they can efficiently handle large amounts of data and keep it organized.
They are perfect for situations where the data structure needs to stay balanced, even when adding or removing a lot of data.
B-trees are also ideal for systems that need to access large chunks of data at once, like reading from or writing to a disk. A good real-life example is searching for a book according to its ISBN as shown [here](b-tree.py)

## 3. 2-3 Tree

### Characteristics:

A 2-3 Tree is a special kind of binary search tree that keeps itself balanced. In this tree:

- Every node (except the leaves) can have 2 or 3 children.
- All the leaves (end nodes) are at the same level, which means the tree is balanced.

### Applications:

2-3 Trees are especially useful in database systems where we need to keep data sorted and balanced, making search operations faster. They are often used in file systems to manage large amounts of data efficiently.

### Python Implementation:

You can find the Python code for the 2-3 Tree [here](two_three_tree.py).

## 4. 2-3-4 Tree

### Characteristics:

A 2-3-4 Tree is an extension of the 2-3 Tree. It allows each node to have 2, 3, or 4 children. This tree stays balanced by splitting nodes as new elements are added, which ensures efficient search and insert operations.

### Applications:

2-3-4 Trees are used in databases and file systems, particularly in implementations of B-trees. They are ideal for managing large datasets where balanced search times are crucial.

### Python Implementation:

You can find the Python code for the 2-3-4 Tree [here](two_three_four_tree.py).
